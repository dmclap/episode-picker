Navigate a terminal to this folder.  It can then be run two ways:

./show_picker.py '<show name>'

python -i show_picker
>>> pick_show(‘<show name>’)

If you don't want to choose a show at all, you can enter shows into "best.txt", one per line. Then, run the program with no arguments, and it will choose a random episode among the shows that are in that file.
